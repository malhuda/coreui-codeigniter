# CoreUI CodeIgniter 3 Admin Template
A CodeIgniter starter admin interface using [CoreUI Bootstrap HTML template](https://github.com/mrholek/CoreUI-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template). You can use this template as a starting point for your CodeIgniter application. I developed this for my personal projects and now I'm uploading it here with a hope that this will save a good amount of time for CodeIgniter developers.

## Main Features:
* Full user CRUD system included for admins
* Optional user signup feature on registration page (if enabled in settings)
* Password reset via email
* Optional 2-step authentication via Twilio API
* A complete user model that provides all main and meta info of users

## How to use
* Upload the zip file's content to your application's root directory
* Create a database and set the credentials in ```application/config/database.php```
* Import the SQL file to your database
* Edit ```config.php``` and set your app's URL. That's all!

Once installed, you can start creating your own models, controllers and views. Happy coding!
